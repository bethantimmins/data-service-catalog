# ‚ùå Example of a *bad* service definition
# What's wrong here (examples):
# - Missing required 'name'
# - 'status' uses an invalid value (should match schema)
# - 'tags' should be a list, not a single string
# - Unknown fields ('random_field') that aren't in the schema
title: Orders Service
description: Just a test with missing fields and wrong types
status: live-instead-of-production
tags: orders  # should be a list: [orders]
random_field: foo
